In order to run the program run the following command: C:/Users/prathap/AppData/Local/Microsoft/WindowsApps/python3.11.exe c:/Users/prathap/Alarm-Clock/Alarm.py

This program is an alarm clock that only deactivates until you answer a math question accurately. This will solve the issue for many people who struggle to wake up in the morning who constantly snooze their alarms and go back to sleep.

Some Improvements to be made:                                                                                                                                  
-Add an alarm sound along with the flashing screen when the alarm goes off.                                         
-Make the UI more visually pleasing.
